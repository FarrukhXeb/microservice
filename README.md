# A Simple Micorservice architecture

This repo is just a simple microservice project to test how things are integrated.
The goal is to remove tightly coupled services, make the development process more smooth. Right now the project has services in separate directories.
Point to ponder upon.

- *Is this the correct way to manage a microservice architecture?*
- *How the deployment process is managed?*
- *What if there is a common feature between the services*
- *How to make it more sercure?*
- *Create separate docs for each microservice?*
